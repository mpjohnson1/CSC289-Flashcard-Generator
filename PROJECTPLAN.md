The objective of this project is to develop and deploy the Flash Card Generator application. This app will help the user create flashcards for study purposes. The finished product aims to be a useful study tool that contributes to users’ academic success. The application will provide the user with an efficient and time-saving way to create cards and keep track of their study progress.

# <a name="_ujfeb2shk83v"></a>**Project Objectives** 
The application will provide users with a way to create flashcards that they can then use to practice with. The objective is to have a system that will save the user time by allowing him or her to create a set of flashcards in minutes.  The application will have features to optimize study habits including organization, progress tracking, shuffling, and being able to mark flashcard as learned.  This will allow the user to be more organized by having everything in digital format while also cutting down on expenditures on paper goods such as physical flashcards. The application will provide a way to categorize the saved flashcards, for example you could have a category about history and the flashcards will be grouped around that topic.  This will save the user time by allowing him to quickly find a set he has already created. 
# <a name="_aueqcueyt8mh"></a><a name="_4bznrdi1kcdu"></a><a name="_f42mg177jvwr"></a>**Project Scope** 
The features that are included are Login, Profile, guest profile, Website, Database with a private/public option, Local/online option, Guest Session with Temporary memory, Text to speech accessibility, and an age-appropriate UI.  The project will not include a mobile phone option and will be limited to only 2 screen sizes.
# **Project Assumptions** 
There is an assumption that the user base will be people interested in using flashcards for study purposes. People will also need to be connected to the internet to use our application. There will be lots of educational content that can be included in the flashcards. The app is expected to be accessible web platforms. Additionally, the project assumes that cloud-based and local storage options will be sufficient for users to save and retrieve their flashcards without major data loss. While offline mode will be supported, it is expected that users will have periodic internet access for synchronizing and backup purposes. Lastly, the app is being developed with the assumption that, despite existing competition, there is sufficient market demand and differentiation for it to attract and retain users. These assumptions will need to be validated through research, user feedback, and technical testing throughout the project lifecycle.
# **Project Constraints** 
**Database Management System -** The choice of a database (SQL, NoSQL) will impact scalability, speed, and data privacy features. If using cloud storage, downtime or API limitations could affect reliability.

**Development Team** – Success is dependent on the expertise of the development team throughout the project lifecycle.

**Time Constraints** – Project must be completed by deadline, core features like login, profiles, and flashcard database should be prioritized in early sprints.

**Availability of Developers** - Team members may have limited availability due to other commitments, affecting deadlines.

**Regulatory & Security -** User profiles and flashcard data must adhere to privacy policies. Temporary guest sessions should not store personal data permanently. User data (login, profiles) must be securely stored and transmitted (e.g., HTTPS, hashed passwords).

**Text-to-Speech API -** The accessibility feature relies on third-party text-to-speech services (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech, AWS Polly). API limits, pricing models, or outages could impact this functionality.

**Hosting & Deployment Services -** The project depends on a hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Firebase, Vercel). Service outages or pricing limitations could disrupt deployment.

**Authentication Provider -** If integrating with third-party authentication (e.g., Google OAuth), API changes, rate limits, or downtime could block login functionality.

**Team Collaboration and Communication** 

We will be using Trello for task tracking and organization and weekly Sprint meetings will be every Wednesday on Microsoft Teams to realign goals and hold open discussion for the week. In addition to collaborating on Trello, GitHub will be a junction for sharing files and editing them directly from our repository. We will update our group on the changes we make using commit notifications or putting messages within the markdown files. The GitHub issues feature will allow us to communicate bug fixes, debugging procedures, or plans for implementing new features. 


**Project Documentation** 

**GitHub:** GitHub will be used for version control for coding applications. There will be a group repository where all members can commit and make changes to any code for the application.  

**Microsoft Teams:** Teams will be used to store and share documents for the project.  All team members will have access to the shared documents and there will be a separate folder for each sprint.

**Trello:** Trello will be used for task management and assignment. 


**Project Management Plan and Methodologies** 

<a name="_hcab5dqecpze"></a>We will use an agile approach that allows for flexibility.  If something needs to change from week to week, we can act quickly to resolve the issue.  We will hold weekly sprint meetings every Wednesday at 7pm to discuss the week’s goals and any issues that arise.  We will incorporate a scrum framework involving 5 different 2-week Sprints.  We will use the project management tool Trello to track tasks for each Sprint.
